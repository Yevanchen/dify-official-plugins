# RssHub Trigger Plugin

Receive RssHub feed notifications in Dify via simple webhooks. Flexible events, rich filters, and optional shared-secret verification.

**Why this plugin**

- Reduce polling: trigger workflows as soon as a feed changes.
- Normalize payloads: pass through standard RSS/Atom fields or custom structures.
- Keep it simple: optional API Key, no server-to-server handshake required.

**What is RSS Hub?**

- RSS Hub is an open‑source project that generates RSS/Atom feeds for websites and services.
- Project homepage (GitHub): https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub
- This plugin is the webhook receiver: it accepts `feed_update` payloads and triggers Dify workflows.

## Features

- Optional API Key verification (header or query param)
- Multiple events with sensible defaults
- Rich, per‑event filters to minimize noise
- Generic item payload passthrough as trigger variables

## Architecture

- Sender: your RssHub deployment, a cron/worker that reads the feed, or any script that transforms a feed update into a JSON POST.
- Receiver: this plugin’s webhook URL (generated by Dify for the trigger). It validates (optionally) and dispatches an event to your workflow.

## Setup

-

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Install/import the plugin into Dify.
3. Subscription configuration:
   - `API Key` (optional):
     - If provided, all webhook calls must include the same key (see Authentication).
     - If left blank, the webhook accepts unauthenticated posts.
4. Copy the generated webhook endpoint URL from your Dify trigger.
5. Configure your RssHub (or a small companion worker) to POST updates to this URL.
   - If using an API Key, include it as described below.
6. (Optional) If you send a custom event name via header/query/body, it will be accepted, but the plugin is optimized for `feed_update`.

## Authentication (Optional)

- Provide a shared `API Key` in the subscription to enable verification.
- Send the same key with each request using one of:
  - HTTP header `X-Api-Key: <your_api_key>` (recommended)
  - HTTP header `Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>`
  - Query string `?token=<your_api_key>` or `?api_key=<your_api_key>`
- If you do not configure an API Key in the subscription, the receiver accepts unauthenticated requests.

## Event Type

- `feed_update`
  - This plugin uses a single event, `feed_update`, and expects the payload structure described in this README.
  - Reference (project): https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub
  - Other custom event names are accepted but are not schema-typed.

## Payload Schema (rss.app)

The plugin exposes the entire JSON body as trigger variables. The canonical schema is:

- `id` (string): Unique identifier for the webhook event
- `type` (string): Event type (currently `feed_update`)
- `feed` (object): Feed metadata
  - `id` (string): Unique identifier for the feed
  - `title` (string): Feed title
  - `source_url` (string): Source website URL
  - `rss_feed_url` (string): RSS feed XML URL
  - `description` (string): Feed description
  - `icon` (string): Favicon/icon URL
- `data` (object): Update details
  - `items_new` (array of objects): New items since the last event
    - `url` (string)
    - `title` (string)
    - `description_text` (string)
    - `thumbnail` (string)
    - `date_published` (date string)
    - `authors` (array of objects)
      - `name` (string)
  - `items_changed` (array of objects): Updated items since the last event
    - `url` (string)
    - `title` (string)
    - `description_text` (string)
    - `thumbnail` (string)
    - `date_published` (date string)
    - `authors` (array of objects)
      - `name` (string)

## Example (cURL)

- feed_update (no auth):

  ```bash

- With API Key in header:
  `curl -X POST '<webhook_url>' -H 'X-Api-Key: <your_api_key>' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"id":"evt_1","type":"feed_update","feed":{},"data":{}}'`

## Tips and Best Practices

- Choose the minimal filter set that captures what you care about; let the plugin ignore the rest upstream.
- Normalize GUID/ID at your notifier side to avoid duplicates.
- If you cannot push directly from RssHub, run a small poller (cron/worker) that converts feed changes into webhook POSTs.
- For unauthenticated mode, prefer allowing only known source IPs or use a secret path segment at your reverse proxy.

## Troubleshooting

- No runs: check event type and filters; try removing filters to validate connectivity.
- 401/403 with API Key: ensure the subscription’s `API Key` matches the header/query you send.
- 400 parse error: ensure `Content-Type: application/json` or send urlencoded with a `payload` JSON field.
- Event mismatch: specify the event explicitly (header or query) to avoid heuristic fallback.

## Limitations

- This plugin does not create/manage RssHub subscriptions. Configure push from your deployment or a companion worker.
- Only shared-secret style verification is supported; there is no OAuth/HMAC at the moment.
